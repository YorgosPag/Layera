Decide between using a controlled or uncontrolled input element and remove one of these props. More info: https://react.dev/link/controlled-components

21:16:41.372 NumericInput.tsx:289 React does not recognize the `thousandSeparator` prop on a DOM element. If you intentionally want it to appear in the DOM as a custom attribute, spell it as lowercase `thousandseparator` instead. If you accidentally passed it from a parent component, remove it from the DOM element.
